A fun implementation of an artificial intelligence to solve the classic MasterMind guessing game using a genetic algorithm. The algorithm implemented is based on the one described in "Efficient solutions for Mastermind using genetic algorithms" by Lotte Berghman, Dries Goossens and Roel Leus of K.U.Leuven. The algorithm proposed has a slightly greater number of guesses than Knuth's famous solution for the classic 4 position 6 color game, but is more efficently scalable, rendering it applicable to more situations.
